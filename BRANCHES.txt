Branches are lines of code that run paralel to the mainline ( or trunk).

Branches are made for various reasons, such as;

An experiment that may not work out.
A project done by a student or intern that must be evaluated seperately.
Minor fixes to an older version of the code while new develoment happens in in the mainline.

The 'current' code for each major release has it's own associated branch in the release_maint directory.
All the Google Summer of Code projets are in the summer of code directory.
The experimental directory contains branches that were used to test new ideas but did not make it fully into the mainline. They are intended as archives.
